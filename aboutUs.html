      <p>
        We are a team of three students in Futuregames Stockholm's Frontend
        Developer program, collaborating on the Version Control Assignment,
        where our goal is to build a multi-page website that explains the basics
        of Git and GitHub to new developers. Together, we are responsible for
        researching accurate information, presenting Git commands in a clear
        way, and designing a responsive site that demonstrates both our
        technical understanding and teamwork. Each of us contribute by creating
        branches, committing changes, opening pull requests, and reviewing each
        otherâ€™s work to ensure the project meets all the passing requirements.
