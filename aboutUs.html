        <p class="subheading__subsection">
          We are a team of three students in Futuregames Stockholm's Frontend
          Developer program, collaborating on the Version Control Assignment,
          where our goal is to build a multi-page website that explains the basics
          of Git and GitHub to new developers. Together, we are responsible for
          researching accurate information, presenting Git commands in a clear
          way, and designing a responsive site that demonstrates both our
          technical understanding and teamwork. Each of us contribute by creating
          branches, committing changes, opening pull requests, and reviewing each
          otherâ€™s work to ensure the project meets all the passing requirements.
