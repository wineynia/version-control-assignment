    <h1>Version Control System</h1>
     <p>A version control system (VCS) is a software tool that tracks and manages changes to files over time, primarily used in software development to record every modification and allow developers to revert to previous states, collaborate seamlessly, and experiment safely. Key features include a complete history of all changes, support for concurrent work through branching, conflict resolution, and providing a single source of truth for a project. </p>
     <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.</p>
     <p>GitHub is a proprietary developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code. It uses Git to provide distributed version control and GitHub itself provides access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.</p>
